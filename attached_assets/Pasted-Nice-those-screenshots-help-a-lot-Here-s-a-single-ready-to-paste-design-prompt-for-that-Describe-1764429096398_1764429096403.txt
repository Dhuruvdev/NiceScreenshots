Nice, those screenshots help a lot.
Here’s a single, ready-to-paste design prompt for that “Describe” box – it will generate a Google-Antigravity-style landing page but themed for Antimomentum (research + office IDE with agentic AI).


---

👉 Prompt to paste:

> Design a clean, futuristic marketing website for a product called Antimomentum – a next-generation Research & Office IDE powered by agentic AI. The style should feel similar in quality to Google Antigravity and other modern Google product pages: lots of white space, soft rounded shapes, subtle dotted/particle backgrounds, big friendly typography, and minimal but high-impact color accents.

Overall vibe: light mode, calm but high-dopamine. Use a mostly white / very light background with soft shadows, thin dividers, and one main accent gradient (electric violet → cyan) that appears in buttons, highlights, and illustrations. Everything should feel anti-gravity, lifting, airy, and premium.

Layout structure:

1. Top navigation bar (sticky):
– Left: Antimomentum logo (simple wordmark with small abstract orbit icon).
– Right: menu items “Product”, “Workspace”, “Agents”, “Use cases”, “Pricing”, “Docs”.
– Far right: “Sign in” (text) and a primary pill button “Get early access”.
Nav is slim, white, with a faint bottom border and slight blur when scrolling.

2. Hero section (above the fold):
– Centered content similar to Google Antigravity hero.
– Small eyebrow text: “Research & Office IDE”
– Main headline: “Flip your momentum into flow.”
– Subtext: one crisp line explaining: “Antimomentum is a research-first IDE where notes, documents, data, and agentic AI live in a single workspace.”
– Two primary call-to-action buttons:
• Solid pill button: “Try the web IDE”
• Ghost pill button: “Watch a 2-minute demo”
– On the right (or below on mobile): a mockup card of the Antimomentum IDE inside a rounded laptop/window frame, showing: left sidebar project tree, dark central canvas with blocks, right panel for AI agents. Background behind the mockup uses a soft dotted field / particle field and a subtle gradient halo to give a liftoff / antigravity feel.

3. Trust / quick stat strip:
Directly under the hero, a horizontal strip with 3–4 small stat cards:
– “Save 5+ hours per week”
– “Replace 6+ tools”
– “Designed for research & office teams”
Use minimal icons, light grey cards with tiny gradient accents.

4. “All-in-one research cockpit” section:
Two-column layout. Left side: screenshot collage of the IDE with overlapping floating cards (note block, PDF preview, data table, chart, code cell). Right side: title and bullets.
Section title: “An IDE for thinking, not just coding.”
Three bullet groups with small icons:
– “Research Canvas – drag notes, docs, PDFs, and datasets into a single infinite space.”
– “Office Mode – write reports, briefs, and documentation without leaving the IDE.”
– “Timeline Streams – replay how a project evolved, step by step.”

5. “Agentic AI for real work” section:
Light grey background band with three or four feature cards for agents. Each card is rounded with a subtle gradient border and a simple icon.
Example cards:
– Research Agent – summarises papers, links notes to sources.
– Office Agent – drafts project updates, meeting notes, and documentation.
– Data Agent – runs queries, updates charts, and writes short insights.
– Workflow Agent – chains actions together on a schedule.
Include a small visual flow diagram showing blocks connected by arrows to represent workflows.

6. “Built like an IDE, feels like a notebook” section:
Split layout again, but reversed.
– Left: text explaining keyboard shortcuts, command palette, multi-panel layout.
– Right: UI mock showing a dark inner working area (IDE) inside the light website, with: left project/stream tree, central tabbed editor, bottom console, right inspector. Use a subtle glow to make it feel like a floating window inside the page.

7. Use cases carousel or cards:
A simple horizontally scrollable carousel or 3-column grid with cards:
– “Academic research”
– “Data & analytics teams”
– “Product & strategy docs”
– “Client reports & proposals”
Each card: icon, short description, tiny “See example workflow” link.

8. Pricing preview section:
Simple, clean, not heavy.
Title: “Start solo, grow as a team.”
Three cards: “Starter”, “Pro”, “Team”.
Light borders, soft drop shadows, toggle for “Monthly / Yearly”. One card (Pro) has a subtle gradient outline to highlight it.

9. Final CTA + footer:
Repeat strong call to action: “Ready to reverse your momentum?”
One main button “Get early access” and one secondary “Talk to us”.
Footer with small logo, slim columns: Product, Company, Resources, Legal, plus social icons. Keep it very minimal like Google product footers.

Design details:
– Lots of breathing room and vertical spacing.
– Rounded rectangles, pill buttons, subtle shadows.
– Thin dotted background patterns and faint gradient blobs to suggest motion and anti-gravity.
– Typography similar to modern Google product pages: large, friendly sans-serif headings and clean body text.
– Every section should feel coherent and consistent as part of a polished SaaS / IDE product site.

Make the whole layout responsive, extremely clean, and visually addictive but still professional, with every element clearly connected to the Antimomentum concept: lifting you out of friction and into focused research + office flow.

You can paste that whole block into the Design box and hit “Start designing”.
If you want, next I can write a separate prompt just for the internal IDE screen (not marketing site), so your landing and product UI match perfectly.
