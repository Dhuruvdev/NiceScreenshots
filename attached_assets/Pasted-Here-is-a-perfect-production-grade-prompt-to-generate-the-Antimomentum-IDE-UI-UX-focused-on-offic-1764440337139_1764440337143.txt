⭐ Antimomentum – IDE for Focus, Research & Work

Master Prompt for UI/UX Generation

PROMPT:

> Design a next-generation intelligent IDE called “Antimomentum.”
Antimomentum is not a coding editor — it is a complete environment where users focus, think, research, document, write, plan, and get work done fast through a clean, powerful, AI-augmented interface.

🎯 Core Concept

Create a unified workspace combining:

Office Work Tools (notes, documents, calendars, tasks, meeting summaries)

Research Tools (AI research assistant, citations, web search, source linking, PDF viewer, insights extraction)

Documentation Tools (structured documents, outlines, multi-page research reports, versioning)

Integrated Thinking Tools (mind maps, whiteboards, concept graphs, brainstorm mode)

Agentic AI Tools (automated tasks, workflow suggestions, writing & research copilots)


The layout must feel like a blend of Notion + ChatGPT Projects + Perplexity + Linear + Apple Notes.
